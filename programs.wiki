The collection takes place at top-level telecommunications facilities within the United States, choke points through which most traffic will flow, including wireless. This type of surveillance is referred to as "[[UPSTREAM]] collection". Among the facilities associated with BLARNEY are AT&T's Room 641A in San Francisco, California, revealed in 2006 by Mark Klein, and another in New Jersey. Like its counterparts, BLARNEY was expanded after the September 11 attacks. Information collected from BLARNEY is shared with many agencies in the United States, including the CIA, NSA, FBI and DOJ, it is also shared with the Five Eyes and NATO. A number of private companies also have access.

""Short Description"" : BOUNDLESSINFORMANT is a big data analysis and data visualization system used by the NSA to give managers summaries of the NSA's world wide data collection activities. According to a Top Secret heat map display also published by The Guardian and produced by the Boundless Informant program, almost 3 billion data elements from inside the United States were captured by the NSA over a 30-day period ending in March 2013.Data analyzed by BOUNDLESSINFORMANT includes electronic surveillance program records ([[DNI]]) and telephone call metadata records ([[DNR]]) stored in an NSA data archive called [[GM-PLACE]]. It does not include FISA data, according to the FAQ memo. [[PRISM]] (US-984XN), which was revealed at the same time as BOUNDLESSINFORMANT, is one source of DNR data. According to the map, BOUNDLESSINFORMANT summarizes data records from 504 separate DNR and DNI collection sources (SIGADs). In the map, countries that are under surveillance are assigned a color from green, representing least coverage to red, most intensive.

""Short Description"" : BULLRUN is a clandestine, highly classified decryption program run by the NSA. The British signals intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) has a similar program codenamed [[EDGEHILL]]. Access to the program is limited to a group of top personnel at the Five Eyes (FVEY), NSA and the signals intelligence agencies of Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Signals that cannot be decrypted with current technology may be retained indefinitely while the agencies continue to attempt to decrypt them: "Documents show that the N.S.A. has been waging a war against encryption using a battery of methods that include working with industry to weaken encryption standards, making design changes to cryptographic software, and pushing international encryption standards it knows it can break."

=== CW ===
""Alias"" :
""Tags"" : [[usb]]
""Short Description"" : Continuous Wave aka [[CW]] is a continuous radio signal (like [[CTX4000]] or [[PHOTOANGLO]]) sent toward a target so that the reflected radio wave is modulated by the signal to intercept. It's the default interception mechanism of NSA for both voice, PS2 and USB keyboard keypresses, exfiltered data, network traffic and any kind of data the NSA is interested to extract from a target. It's a very advanced attack where a Radar sends a [[CW]] toward a target covertly equipped with a eavesdropping bug called a [[RETROREFLECTOR]] which will modulate the original [[CW]] signal and re-radiate this modulated [[CW]] so that it can be picked up by the emitting Radar. The benefit of such technique is that there is no need for the eavesdropping bug to generate radio signal, and therefore, no need for huge batteries or power. It also means that the bug can be turned on and off remotely, providing easy way to turn off the bug when a bug sweep detection team is trying to located it. The downside is that it's dangerous for health as the Radar signal between 1Ghz and 6Ghz can be harmful to human and cause illness and cancer, as it did numerous times in the past since the first time it was detected in the US Embassy in Moscow, Russia.

FEEDTROUGH can be used to persist two  implants, [[ZESTYLEAK]] and/or [[BANANAGLEE]] across reboots and  software upgrades on known and covered OS's for the following Netscreen  firewalls, ns5xt, ns25, ns50, ns200, ns500 and ISG 1000. There is no  direct communication to or from FEEDTROUGH, but if present, the  [[BANANAGLEE]] implant can receive and transmit covert channel comms,  and for certain platforms, [[BANANAGLEE]] can also update FEEDTROUGH.  FEEDTROUGH however can only persist OS's included in its databases.  Therefore this is best employed with known OS's and if a new OS comes  out, then the customer would need to add this OS to the FEEDTROUGH  database for that particular firewall.

=== FOXACID ===
""Alias"" :
""Tags"" : [[tor]]
""Short  Description"" : FOXACID identifies TOR users on the Internet and then  executes an attack against their Firefox web browser.
# finding Tor users via programs codenamed [[STORMBREW]], [[FAIRVIEW]], [[OAKSTAR]] and [[BLARNEY|]].
# The NSA creates "fingerprints" that detect HTTP requests from the Tor network to particular servers.
# These fingerprints are loaded into NSA database systems like [[XKEYSCORE]],
#  Using powerful data analysis tools with codenames such as  [[TURBULENCE]], [[TURMOIL]] and [[TUMULT]], the NSA automatically look  for Tor connections.
#  After the identification, the NSA uses its network of secret Internet  servers to redirect those users to another set of secret Internet  servers, with the codename [[FOXACID]], to infect the user's computer.
#  Once the computer is successfully attacked, it secretly calls back to a  [[FoxAcid]] server, which then performs additional attacks on the  target computer to ensure that it remains compromised long-term, and  continues to provide eavesdropping information back to the NSA.

As the drone circles, the device locates the  SIM card or  handset that the military believes is used by the target.  That, in turn, allows the military to track the cell phone to within 30   feet of its actual location, feeding the real-time data to teams of   drone operators who conduct missile strikes or facilitate night raids.

=== HEADWATER ===
""Alias"" :
""Tags"" :  [[router]] [[huawei]]
""Short  Description"" : HEADWATER is a Persistent Backdoor (PDB) software  implant for selected Huawei routers. The implant will enable covert  functions to be remotely executed within the router via an Internet  connection.
HEADWATER  PBD implant will be transferred remotely over the Internet to the  selected target router by Remote Operations Center ([[ROC]]) personnel.  After the transfer process is complete, the PBD will be installed in the  router's boot ROM via an upgrade command. The PBD will then be  activated after a system reboot. Once activated, the ROC operators will  be able to use DNT's [[HAMMERMILL]] Insertion Tool (HIT) to control the  PBD as it captures and examines all IP packets passing through the host  router.
HEADWATER  is the cover term for the PBD for Huawei Technologies routers. PBD has  been adopted for use in the joint NSA/CIA effort to exploit Huawei  network equipment. The cover name for this joint project is  [[TURBOPANDA]].

=== JETPLOW ===
""Alias"" :
""Tags"" : [[cisco]] [[router]]
""Short  Description"" : JETPLOW is a firmware persistence implant for Cisco PIX  Series and ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) firewalls. It persists  DNT's [[BANANAGLEE]] software implant. JETPLOW also has a persistent  back-door capability.
He  is a firmware persistence impant for Cisco PIX Series and ASA (Adaptive  Security Appliance) firewalls. It persists DNT's [[BANANAGLEE]]  software implant and modifies the Cisco firewall's operating system (OS)  at boot time. If [[BANANAGLEE]] support is not available for the  booting operating system, it can install a Persistent Backdoor (PDB)  designed to work with [[BANANAGLEE]]'S communications structure, so that  full access can be reacquired at a later time. JETPLOW works on Cisco's  500-series PIX firewalls, as well as most ASA firewalls (5505, 5510,  5520, 5540, 5550). A typical JETPLOW deployment on a target firewall  with an exfiltration path to the Remote Operations Center ([[ROC]]) is  shown above. JETPLOW is remotely upgradable and is also remotely  installable provided [[BANANAGLEE]] is already on the firewall of  interest. Has been widely deployed. Current availability restricted  based on OS version (inquire for details).

=== LOUDAUTO ===
""Alias"" :
""Tags"" :
""Short  Description"" : Audio-based RF retro-reflector. Provides room audio  from targeted space using radar and basic post-processing. LOUDAUTO's  current design maximizes the gain of the microphone. This makes it  extremely useful for picking up room audio. It can pick up speech at a  standard, office volume from over 20' away. (NOTE: Concealments may  reduce this distance.) It uses very little power (~15 uA at 3.0 VDC), so  little, in fact, that battery self-discharge is more of an issue for  serviceable lifetime than the power draw from this unit. The simplicity  of the design allows the form factor to be tailored for specific  operation requirements. All components at COTS and so are  non-attributable to NSA.

Room  audio is picked up by the microphone and converted into an analog  electrical signal. This signal is used to pulse position modulate (PPM) a  square wave signal running at a pre-set frequency. This square wave is  used to turn a FET (field effect transistor) on and off. When the unit  is illuminated with a CW signal from a nearby radar unit, the  illuminating signal is amplitude-modulated with the PPM square wave.  This signal is re-radiated, where it is picked up by the radar, then  processed to recover the room audio. processing is currently performed  by COTS equipment with FM demodulation capability (Rohde & Schwarz  FSH-series portable spectrum analyzers, etc.) LOUDAUTO is part of the  [[ANGRYNEIGHBOR]] family of radar retro-reflectors.

""Short  Description"" : A custom Tor client library meant to be  indistinguishable from the original Tor client, but which allows an  unlimited number of servers within the Tor circuit. This was to allow  for DoS attacks on the Tor network. It was also hypothesized that  MJOLNIR would be able to be used for MITM attacks by forging  certificates. The library was created and tested by persons during a  2006 CES summer program who set up an internal Tor network to analyze  traffic. Mjolnir was the “Hammer of Thor” - a possible pun.

""Short  Description"" : MUSCULAR (DS-200B), located in the United Kingdom, is  the name of a surveillance programme jointly operated by GCHQ and the  NSA. GCHQ (primary operator of the program) and the NSA have secretly  broken into the main communications links that connect Yahoo and Google  data centers around the world. Substantive information about the program  was made public at the end of October, 2013. MUSCULAR is one of at  least four other similar programs that rely on a trusted 2nd party,  programs which together are known as [[WINDSTOP]]. In a 30-day period  from December 2012 to January 2013, MUSCULAR was responsible for  collecting 181 million records. It was however dwarfed by another  [[WINDSTOP]] program known (insofar) only by its code [[DS-300]] and  codename [[INCENSER]], which collected over 14 billion records in the  same period.

=== NIGHTSTAND ===
""Alias"" :
""Tags"" :
""Short  Description"" : An active 802.11 wireless exploitation and injection  tool for payload /exploit delivery into otherwise denied target space.  NIGHTSTAND is typically used in operations where wired access to the  target is not possible. Standalone tool currently running on an x86  laptop loaded with Linux Fedora Core 3. Exploitable targets include  Win2k, WinXP, WinXPSP1, WinXPSP2 running internet explorer versions  5.0-6.0. NIGHTSTAND packet injection can target one client or multiple  targets on a wireless network. Attack is undetectable by the user. Use  of external amplifiers and antennas in both experimental operational  scenarios have resulted in successful NIGHTSTAND attacks from as far  away as eight miles under ideal environmental conditions. Presumably,  the NSA can use this "injection tool" in all the same ways it uses  [[QUANTUM]]. For example, it can redirect users to [[FOXACID]] servers  in order to attack their computers.

The  video output from an appropriate collection system, such as a  [[[CTX4000]], [[PHOTOANGLO]], or general-purpose receiver, is connected  to the video output on the [[NIGHTWATCH]] system. The user, using the  appropriate tools either within [[NIGHTWATCH]] or externally, determines  the horizontal and vertical sync frequencies of the targeted monitor.  Once the user matches the proper frequencies, he activates "Sync Lock"  and frame averaging to reduce noise and improve readability of the  targeted monitor. If warranted, the user then forwards the displayed  frames over a network to [[NSAW]], where analysts can look at them for  intelligence purposes.

OAKSTAR  is an umbrella program involving surveillance of telecommunications, it  falls under the category of "[[UPSTREAM collection," meaning that data  is pulled directly from fiber-optic cables and top-level communications  infrastructure. [[UPSTREAM]] collection programs allow access to very  high volumes of data, and most of the pre-selection is done by the  providers themselves, before the data is passed on to the NSA. The FY  2013 budget for OAKSTAR is $9.41 million.

=== PHOTOANGLO ===
""Alias"" :
""Tags"" :
""Short  Description"" : Replaces [[CTX4000]], a continuous radar Wave  generator, for the [[ANGRYNEIGHBOR]] family of retro-reflector bugs,  including [[VAGRANT]], [[DROPMIRE]] and [[LOADAUTO]]. The signals are  then sent to a processing system such as [[NIGHTWATCH]] or [[VIEWPLATE]]  (which process and display the signals from the [[VAGRANT]]  monitor-cable bug). The [[LFS-2]] is listed as another type of  processing system. A joint NSA/GCHQ project.

The  radar unit generates an un-modulated, continuous wave ([[CW]]) signal.  The oscillator is either generated internally, or externally through a  signal generator or cavity oscillator. The unit amplifies the signal and  sends it out to an RF connector, where it is directed to some form of  transmission antenna (horn, parabolic dish, LPA, spiral). The signal  illuminates the target system and is re-radiated. The receive antenna  picks up the re-radiated signal and directs the signal to the receive  input. The signal is amplified, filtered, and mixed with the transmit  antenna. The result is a homodyne receiver in which the RF signal is  mixed directly to baseband. The baseband video signal is ported to an  external BNC connector. This connects to a processing system, such as  [[NIGHTWATCH]], an [[LFS-2]], or [[VIEWPLATE]], to process the signal  and provide the intelligence.

However, according to ''Homeland Security Today'', Pinwale has in it  much more than email, it also contains other forms of Internet data, and  other forms of digital communications as well. Its software has  built-in protections against collecting from any of the Five Eyes  members. Unlike its successor [[XKEYSCORE]], targets for PINWALE have to  be approved beforehand by the United States Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court ([[FISC]]).

=== PRISM ===
""Alias"" : [[US-984XN]]
""Tags"" : [[phone]]
""Short  Description"" : PRISM is a clandestine mass electronic surveillance  data mining program known to have been operated by the United States  National Security Agency (NSA) since 2007. PRISM is a government code  name for a data-collection effort.The PRISM program collects stored  Internet communications based on demands made to Internet companies such  as Google Inc. and Apple Inc. under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments  Act of 2008 to turn over any data that match court-approved search  terms. The NSA can use these PRISM requests to target communications  that were encrypted when they traveled across the Internet backbone, to  focus on stored data that telecommunication filtering systems discarded  earlier, and to get data that is easier to handle, among other things.  The program is operated under the supervision of the U.S. Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court, or FISC) pursuant to the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Documents indicate that  PRISM is "the number one source of raw intelligence used for NSA  analytic reports", and it accounts for 91% of the NSA's Internet traffic  acquired under FISA section 702 authority. The leaked information came  to light one day after the revelation that the FISA Court had been  ordering a subsidiary of telecommunications company Verizon  Communications to turn over to the NSA logs tracking all of its  customers' telephone calls on an ongoing daily basis.

""Alias"" :
""Tags"" : [[tor]] [[mots]]
""Short  Description"" : To trick targets into visiting a [[FOXACID]] server,  the NSA relies on its secret partnerships with US telecoms companies. As  part of the [[TURMOIL]] system, the NSA places secret servers,  codenamed [[QUANTUM]], at key places on the Internet backbone for a  man-in-the-middle (or a man-in-the-side). The NSA uses these fast  [[QUANTUM]] servers to execute a packet injection attack, which  surreptitiously redirects the target to the [[FOXACID]] server.

=== RAGEMASTER ===
""Alias"" :
""Tags"" :[[rf]] [[video]]
""Short  Description"" : provides a target for RF flooding and allows for easier  collection of the [[VAGRANT]] video signal. The current RAGEMASTER unit  taps the red video line on the VGA cable. It was found that,  empirically, this provides the best video return and cleanest readout of  the monitor contents. When the RAGEMASTER is illuminated by a radar  unit, the illuminating signal is modulated with the red video  information. This information is re-radiated, where it is picked up at  the radar, demodulated, and passed onto the processing unit, such as a  [[LFS-2]] and an external monitor.

=== SCHOOLMONTANA ===
""Alias"" :
""Tags"" : [[router]] [[juniper]]  [[bios]]
""Short  Description"" : SCHOOLMONTANA provides persistence for DNT implants.  The DNT implant will survive an upgrade or replacement of the operating  system -- including physically replacing the router's compact flash  card. Currently, the intended DNT Implant to persist is [[VALIDATOR]],  which must be run as a user process on the target operating system. The  vector of attack is the modification of the target's BIOS. The  modification will add the necessary software to the BIOS and modify its  software to execute the SCHOOLMONTANA implant at the end of its native  System Management Mode (SMM) handler.
SCHOOLMONTANA  must support all modern versions of Junos, which is a version of  FreeBSD customized by Juniper. Upon system boot, the Junos operating  system is modified in memory to run the implant, and provide persistent  kernel modifications to support implant execution. SCHOOLMONTANA is the  cover term for the persistence technique to deploy a DNT implant to  Juniper J-Series routers. SCHOOLMONTANA completed and released by ANT  May 30, 2008. It is ready for deployment.

=== SIERRAMONTANA ===
""Alias"" :
""Tags"" : [[router]] [[juniper]]  [[bios]]
""Short  Description"" : SIERRAMONTANA provides persistence for DNT implants.  The DNT implant will survive an upgrade or replacement of the operating  system -- including physically replacing the router's compact flash  card.
Currently,  the intended DNT Implant to persist is [[VALIDATOR]], which must be run  as a user process on the target operating system. The vector of attack  is the modification of the target's BIOS. The modification will add the  necessary software to the BIOS and modify its software to execute the  SIERRAMONTANA implant at the end of its native System Management Mode  (SMM) handler. SIERRAMONTANA must support all modern versions of JUNOS,  which is a version of FreeBSD customized by Juniper. Upon system boot,  the JUNOS operating system is modified in memory to run the implant, and  provide persistent kernel modifications to support implant execution.
SIERRAMONTANA  is the cover term for the persistence technique to deploy a DNT implant  to Juniper M-Series routers. The codename [[VALIDATOR]] is the code  name for a default, or basic, NSA exploit. It's the exploit that  [[FOXACID]] defaults to using.

=== SOUFFLETROUGH ===
""Alias"" :
""Tags"" :[[router]] [[juniper]]  [[bios]]
""Short  Description"" : SOUFFLETROUGH is a BIOS persistence implant for Juniper  SSG 500 and SSG 300 firewalls. It persists DNT's [[BANANAGLEE]]  software implant. [[BANANAGLEE]] also has an advanced persistent  back-door capability. SOUFFLETROUGH is a BIOS persistence implant for  Juniper SSG 500 and SSG 300 series firewalls (320M, 350M, 520, 550,  520M, 550M). It persists DNT's [[BANANAGLEE]] software implant and  modifies the Juniper firewall's operating system (ScreenOS) at boot  time. If [[BANANAGLEE]] support is not available for the booting  operating system, it can install a Persistent Backdoor (PBD) designed to  work with [[BANANAGLEE]]'s communications structure, so that full  access can be reacquired at a later time. It takes advantage of Intel's  System Management Mode for enhanced reliability and covertness. The PDB  is also able to beacon home, and is fully configurable. A typical  SOUFFLETROUGH deployment on a target firewall with an exfiltration path  to the Remote Operations Center (ROC) is shown above. SOUFFLETROUGH is  remotely upgradeable and is also remotely installable provided  [[BANANAGLEE]] is already on the firewall of interest.

""Short  Description"" : [[STELLARWIND]] is the code name of a Sensitive  Compartmented Information security compartment for information collected  under the President's Surveillance Program (PSP). This was a program by  the United States National Security Agency (NSA) during the presidency  of George W. Bush and revealed by Thomas Tamm to the The New York Times  in 2008. The operation was approved by President George W. Bush shortly  after the September 11 attacks in 2001. STELLARWIND was succeeded during  the presidency of Barack Obama by four major lines of intelligence  collection in the territorial United States together capable of spanning  the full range of modern telecommunications. The program's activities  involved data mining of a large database of the communications of  American citizens, including email communications, phone conversations,  financial transactions, and Internet activity.

""Short  Description"" :[[STORMBREW]] is an umbrella program involving  surveillance of telecommunications. It falls under the category of  "[[UPSTREAM]] collection," meaning that data is pulled directly from  fiber-optic cables and top-level communications infrastructure. There is  also a SIGAD of the same name, which is described as a "key corporate  partner." A map shows that the collection is done entirely within the  United States. This corporate partner has servers in Washington,  California, Texas, Florida, and in or around New York, Virginia, and  Pennsylvania. [[UPSTREAM]] collection programs allow access to very high  volumes of data, and most of the pre-selection is done by the providers  themselves, before the data is passed on to the NSA.

The [[DNT]]  implant will survive an upgrade or replacement of the operating system -  including physically replacing the router's compact flash card.  Currently, the intended DNT Implant to persist is [[VALIDATOR]], which  must be run as a user process on the target operating system. The vector  of attack is the modification of the target's BIOS. The modification  will add the necessary software to the BIOS and modify its software to  execute the [[SIERRAMONTANA]] implant at the end of its native System  Management Mode (SMM) handler.
[[STUCCOMONTANA]]  must support all modern versions of JUNOS, which is a version of  FreeBSD customized by Juniper. Upon system boot, the [[JUNOS]] operating  system is modified in memory to run the implant, and provide persistent  kernel modifications to support implant execution.
[[STUCCOMONTANA]] is the cover term for the persistence technique to deploy a DNT implant to Juniper T-Series routers.

=== TAWDRYYARD ===
""Alias"" :
""Tags"" :
""Short  Description"" : Beacon RF retro-reflector. Provides return when  illuminated with radar to provide rough positional location. TAWDRYYARD  is used as a beacon, typically to assist in locating and identifying  deployed [[RAGEMASTER]] units. Current design allows it to be detected  and located quite easily within a 50' radius of the radar system being  used to illuminate it. TAWDRYYARD draws as 8 mu;A at 2.5V (20mu;W)  allowing a standard lithium coin cell to power it for months or years.  The simplicity of the design allows the form factor to be tailored for  specific operational requirements. Future capabilities being considered  are return of GPS coordinates and a unique target identifier and  automatic processing to scan a target area for presence of TAWDRYYARDs.  All components are COTS and so are non-attributable to NSA.
The  board generates a square wave operating at a preset frequency. This  square wave is used to turn a FET (field effect transistor) on and off.  When the unit is illuminated with a CW signal, the illuminating signal  is amplitude-modulated (AM) with the square wave. This signal is  re-radiated, where it is picked up by the radar, then processed to  recover the clock signal. Typically, the fundamental is used to indicate  the unit's presence, and is simply displayed on a low frequency  spectrum analyzer. TAWDRYYARD is part of the [[ANGRYNEIGHBOR]] family of  radar retro-reflectors. Among future capabilities is to allow  TAWDRYYARD to scan a target area for the presence of [[TWDRYYARD]]

""Short  Description"" : THINTREAD is the name of a project that the NSA pursued  during the 1990s. The program involved wiretapping and sophisticated  analysis of the resulting data, but according to the article, the  program was discontinued three weeks before the September 11, 2001  attacks due to the changes in priorities and the consolidation of U.S.  intelligence authority. The "change in priority" consisted of the  decision made by the director of NSA General Michael V. Hayden to go  with a concept called [[TRAILBLAZER]], despite the fact that THINTREAD  was a working prototype that protected the privacy of U.S. citizens.
ThinThread was dismissed and replaced by the [[TRAILBLAZER]] Project

=== TURBULENCE ===
""Alias"" :
""Tags"" :[[malware]]
""Short  Description"" : TURBULENCE is a project started circa 2005. It was  developed in small, inexpensive "test" pieces rather than one grand plan  like its failed predecessor, the [[TRAILBLAZER]]. It also includes  offensive cyber-warfare capabilities, like injecting malware into remote  computers. The United States Congress criticized the project in 2007  for having similar bureaucratic problems as the [[TRAILBLAZER]] Project.  TURBULENCE includes nine core programs, with intriguing names such as  [[TURMOIL]], [[TUTELAGE]] and [[TRAFFICTHIEF]]

""Short  Description"" : Unmanned aerial vehicle. A drone. The NSA is using  complex analysis of electronic surveillance, rather than human   intelligence, as the primary method to locate targets for lethal drone   strikes – an unreliable tactic that results in the deaths of innocent  or  unidentified people. In one tactic, the NSA “geolocates” the SIM  card or handset of a suspected terrorist’s mobile phone, enabling the  CIA and U.S. military to conduct night raids and drone strikes to kill  or capture the individual in possession of the device.

""Short  Description"" :The UPSTREAM program is a telecommunication interception  facility operated by [[AT&T]] for the NSA that commenced operations  in 2003 and was exposed in 2006. Room 641A is located in the SBC  Communications building at 611 Folsom Street, San Francisco, three  floors of which were occupied by AT&T before SBC purchased AT&T.  The room was referred to in internal AT&T documents as the SG3  [Study Group 3] Secure Room. It is fed by fiber optic lines from beam  splitters installed in fiber optic trunks carrying Internet backbone  traffic and, as analyzed by J. Scott Marcus, a former CTO for GTE and a  former adviser to the FCC, has access to all Internet traffic that  passes through the building, and therefore "the capability to enable  surveillance and analysis of internet content on a massive scale,  including both overseas and purely domestic traffic." Former director of  the NSA's World Geopolitical and Military Analysis Reporting Group,  William Binney, has estimated that 10 to 20 such facilities have been  installed throughout the United States.

Known to be deployed in the  field , as of September 2010 at the following embassies: Brazil's UN  Mission in NY ([[POKOMOKE]]), France's UN Mission in NY ([[BLACKFOOT]]),  India's Embassy and annex in DC, and India's UN Mission in New York.  India's embassies were slated to be detasked, at the time of the  document. Context of documents seems to suggest, but does not  definitively prove that the coverterm VAGRANT only applies to the signal  itself.

=== VALIDATOR ===

""Short  Description"" : A software based malware item designed to run on  certain Juniper routers (J, M, and T Series) running the JUNOS operating  system. It must be maintained by means of a malicious BIOS  modification. A typical use case involves the exfiltration of data from  the victimized system. A separate document describes VALIDATOR as a  backdoor used against Windows systems (win 98-2003). In this instance,  it will identify the system, and if it is truly a target, invite a more  sophisticated trojan in, such as [[UNITEDRAKE]] or [[OLYMPUS]]. This  trojan has been used to de-anonymize tor users. A third version of  VALIDATOR works for Apple iOS devices. The [[QUANTUMNATION]] states that  the success rate against iOS devices is 100%.

""Short  Description"" : XKEYSCORE is a formerly secret computer system used by  the NSA for searching and analyzing Internet data about foreign  nationals across the world. The program is run jointly with other  agencies including Australia's [[DSD]], and New Zealand's [[GCSB]].  XKEYSCORE is an NSA data-retrieval system which consists of a series of  user interfaces, backend databases, servers and software that selects  certain types of metadata that the NSA has already collected using other  methods.
According to the published slides, these come from three different sources:
*  [[FORNSAT]] - which means "foreign satellite collection", and refers to  intercepts from satellites [[ECHELON]] that process data used by other  countries
* Overhead - American satellites
